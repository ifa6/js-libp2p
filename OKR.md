# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

- [P1] libp2p has a network visualization tool - @jacobheun
- [P1] js-libp2p has a daemon with a RPC API and a client library - @jacobheun
- [P1] interop tests for go-libp2p and js-libp2p exist for core functionality - @vasco-santos
- [P0] a testbed exists and can test 50,000 libp2p nodes (browser and node) - @jacobheun
- [P0] the testbed can run large scale tests for the DHT and Pubsub - @vasco-santos

**Connectivity Magic is better and more reliable**

- [P0] IPNS works over DHT and is interoperable with go - @vasco-santos
- [P1] IPNS spec exists and is complete - @vasco-santos

- [P0] onboard 3 new contributors to the js-libp2p team - @mgoelzer

Once these OKRs are finished, you will be able to find them on the [2018 Q4 libp2p OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BYwmbVicgo6_tOHAbgiUXWge8Ej0qR1M_gAUulazmrg/edit#gid=1241853194)
